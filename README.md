# Reading List

This is a reading list of books, blogs and sites that aims to:

* Document my own reading and learning.
* Be used by other programmers starting out, to be a useful guide for their reading.
* At a future date this will be expanded into a website that others can contribute to, to share useful reading lists in the community.

# Set up

In its first iteration this Reading List is in simple markdown, but will be transferred to a site in 2017.

Set up instructions will be provided as the project develops, in the meantime: enjoy!
